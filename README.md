# Pathfinding Visualizer

A grid-based pathfinding visualizer that demonstrates classic graph search algorithms step by step.

## Algorithms (Planned)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- A* Search

## Motivation
This project was built to strengthen understanding of graph algorithms and visualize how different strategies explore a search space.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pygame

## Future Improvements
- Weighted grids
- Maze generation
- Performance comparisons
